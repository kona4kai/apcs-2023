## Project Description (What did I build?)

I built a connect 4 game in which you can code competing bots. This includes working with Logan to create a visual representation of live games.

## What I learned

I furthered my understanding of programming in java. This includes:
 - Learning how to represent a real-life game using java classes.
 - Learning how to code java classes which use java interfaces to establish standardize class usage.
 - Improving my ability to code recursive functions.
 - Improving my ability to code with others.

## How you can try it

1. Go to the RunGam.java or Run100Games.java classes. Here you watch existing bots fight or change the bots which are fighting other in the main method.
2. Create your own bot implementing the BotInterface.java class. Feel free to use other bots as reference.

## Why this is cool

This is cool because anyone can create competing bots (AND FIGHT FOR GLORY!!!). It also has a nice interface which makes it fun to use.
