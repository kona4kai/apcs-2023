# Kai's Topics to Review

  - ~~Search Types~~
      - Linear/Sequential Search: Searches through all one-by-one to find item. Worst case = list length.
      - Binary Search: MUST BE SORTED! Searches by repeatedly dividing the list. Worst case = log2 of list length. 
  - ~~Sorting types/speeds~~
      - Selection, Insertion, and Bubble Sort: compares pairs of list items. Worst case = list length squared
      - Merge and Quicksort: Recursively divides list in half, sorts each half (Quicksort by pivot), then merges. Worst case = list length * log2 of list length.
  - Encapsulation
  - De Morgans' laws
  - ~~Boolean order of operations~~
     1. equality/relational (== !=, < > <= >=)
     2. logical AND (&&)
     3. logical OR (||)
  - Reasons for using an inheritance heirarchy
  - Immutability of Strings (and other types?)
