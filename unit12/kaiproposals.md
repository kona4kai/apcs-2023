Kai Wallis's Proposals

# Project Proposal 2: Create Connect 4 Game

Create a method which runs matches between different peer-made Connect 4 bots. The game should track the game board using a 2D array and check the legality of moves, determining the winner based on the standard rules of connect 4 and if a game engine fails.


## Decomposition

This project involves creating classes which:
1. Represents a changing Connect 4 board using a 2D array of stone objects.
2. Alternates calling methods in each bot class that returns their chosen moves.
3. Checks the legality of the bot's move.
4. Determines the winner between the two bots.
5. Represents the game board as a user interface.
6. Game automatically completes a tournament between a folder of game engines. (maybe?)
7. Game is hosted online. (maybe?)


## I will learn

- Creation of interfaces.
- Representation of an actual game with 2D arrays and custom objects.
- Creation and passing of efficient, easy to interpret data between classes.
- Creation of a user interface.
- Parsing and running of classes in a folder. (maybe?)
- Online interfacing between code. (maybe?)


# Project Proposal 2: Create Checkers Game

Create a method which runs matches between different peer-made checkers bots. The game should track the game board using a 2D array and check the legality of moves, determining the winner based on the standard rules of checkers and if a game engine fails.


## Decomposition

This project involves creating classes which:
1. Represents a changing checkers board using a 2D array of pawn objects.
2. Alternates calling methods in each bot class that returns their chosen moves.
3. Checks the legality of the bot's move.
4. Determines the winner between the two bots.
5. Represents the game board as a user interface.
6. Game automatically completes a tournament between a folder of game engines. (maybe?)
7. Game is hosted online. (maybe?)

# Project Proposal 3: Connect 4/Checkers Game Engine Tournament

Given a standard interface to implement, students will create competing checkers game engines. These game engines will be ran against each other, alternating turns until one game engine wins, fails, or both engines get stuck in a loop.

## Decomposition

This project involves creating a class which:
1. Properly implements a standard interface.
2. Correctly interprets a 2D array of objects (checkers pieces with a team & piece type).
3. Logically determines the best legal move.
4. Returns its move.
5. Is easy to understand with methods which perform single tasks.


## I will learn

- Implementation of interfaces
- Interpretation of 2D arrays and custom objects.
- Code Segmentation for complex operations.
